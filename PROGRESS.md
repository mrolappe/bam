## Round 0 — 2026-08-06 · Setup and planning

**Done:**

- Git repo initialized; public GitHub repo created and pushed:
  https://github.com/mrolappe/bam
- First plan written from `bam-handoff.md`.
- Plan revised to absorb ten further requirements (below), then split into
  `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as index plus conventions, and ten phase documents
  under `docs/plan/`.
- 67 tasks across 10 phases, each with a model tier, a *Tests first* list, a
  *Hand over* list, and a *Done when* check.

**No code yet.** The workspace does not exist.

### Requirements absorbed in the revision

TDD as the working method · a future web app variant alongside the desktop GUI
and TUI · pluggable query languages, with highlight rules naming theirs ·
pluggable archive unpackers · configurable keybindings with a vim-style input
model architected for modes, motions, and package-set "objects" · configurable
token-bucket rate limit · pluggable, cross-platform emulator launchers ·
persistent, queryable selections of packages · llama.cpp preferred over Ollama ·
Vue for the frontend.

## Round 1 — 2026-08-06 · Workspace scaffold + fixtures

**Done:**

- **P0.1** — Cargo workspace created: root `Cargo.toml` (resolver 2, edition
  2024, `rust-version = "1.85"`), `crates/bam-core` (lib, `default =
  ["native"]` gating `rusqlite`/`reqwest`/`tokio`), `crates/bam-tui` (bin
  `bam`). All three acceptance checks pass. rusqlite pinned to `0.32` —
  its `fts5` cargo feature doesn't exist (there's no separate toggle);
  `bundled` alone compiles FTS5 into the amalgamation
  (`-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5` is unconditional in `libsqlite3-sys`'s bundled
  build), so the workspace `Cargo.toml`'s `rusqlite` feature list is just
  `["bundled"]`.
- **P0.2** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: fmt/clippy/test matrix on
  ubuntu-latest + macos-latest. Green locally; not yet observed green on a
  GitHub runner (see below).
- **P0.3** — wasm32 job added to the same workflow, required (not `continue-on-error`).
  **The plan's suggested sabotage doesn't reproduce a failure**: `use
  std::process::Command;` alone still passes `cargo check` for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, because that target's std ships a real (always-
  erroring) `process` module rather than omitting it. Used an unconditional
  `use rusqlite::Connection;` instead — that's the sabotage that actually
  fails, and it's arguably the more faithful test of invariant I1 anyway.
  Amended in `phase-0-scaffold.md`.
- **P0.4** — Core purity test at `crates/bam-core/tests/purity.rs`, walking
  `src/` by hand (no new dependency). All four acceptance cases verified by
  temporary sabotage-and-revert, including the `src/store/`-exemption case.
- **P1.1** — Fixtures fetched from `https://ftp.fau.de/aminet/` (2026-08-06):
  `index_sample.txt` (506 lines, curated — see
  `crates/bam-core/tests/fixtures/README.md` for exactly which lines and why),
  `recent_sample.txt` (74 lines) and `tree_sample.txt` (381 lines), both
  committed in full.

**Not yet done:** the four CI jobs have not been observed green on GitHub —
this round didn't push and watch Actions run. Confirm on the next push
(should be immediate, since everything is green locally with the same
commands the workflow runs).

**Deviation for the next session to know about:** `grep` in this shell is
aliased to `ugrep -a`-less (`-I`, skip binary), which silently returns zero
matches on `fixtures/index_sample.txt` (detected binary, since it carries raw
Latin-1 bytes) and would do the same on any future INDEX-derived file. Use
`grep -a` or `perl -ne 'print if /pattern/'` against files under
`tests/fixtures/` or real Aminet data.

## Next task

**Round 2 — P1.2–P1.3** (Opus + Haiku tier).
See [phase-1-ingest.md](docs/plan/phase-1-ingest.md) for the full task
entries.

1. **P1.2** (Opus) — Schema: `landing_index_line`, `package`, `enrichment`,
   `selection`/`selection_member`. All DDL under
   `crates/bam-core/src/store/` (invariant I1). Three decisions that must not
   get smoothed away: `landing_index_line.raw` is **BLOB, not TEXT**;
   `package.date_precision` (`'week'|'exact'`, upgrade-only one-directional);
   `enrichment` cascades on package delete but survives re-derivation of
   `package` from `landing_index_line`. Hand over: `bam-handoff.md` §5.1,
   §5.2, §13's encoding paragraph; invariants I1 and I7; the P1.1 fixture.
2. **P1.3** (Haiku) — Migration runner: numbered `.sql` files under
   `crates/bam-core/migrations/`, applied via SQLite's `user_version` pragma,
   embedded with `include_str!`. No down-migrations. Skip `refinery` /
   `sqlx-migrate` — a loop over embedded files is shorter.

**Round 2 ends when** the five P1.2 tests pass against a fresh database
(round-trip insert/select on all five tables, `UNIQUE(dir, file)` rejected
duplicate, cascade-on-delete with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`, `package`
droppable/rebuildable without touching `landing_index_line`, BLOB round-trips
invalid UTF-8 byte-identically) and the three P1.3 tests pass (fresh DB gets
every table, re-applying is a no-op, a DB at version N only runs migrations >
N).

## Decisions carried forward

The eight architectural invariants are stated in full in
[`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). In brief:

- **I1** `bam-core` compiles to wasm32 with `--no-default-features`; host
  capabilities live behind traits; `rusqlite` is confined to
  `bam_core::store::*`.
- **I2** The query IR plus field registry is the contract; surface syntaxes are
  pluggable implementations over it.
- **I3** Highlight rules name their query language, defaulting from config.
- **I4** Query languages, unpackers, and launchers share one registry pattern.
  Unpackers dispatch on magic bytes, not extensions.
  `Launcher::capabilities()` drives behaviour, not just reporting.
- **I5** The API layer is session-scoped: no global state, typed serializable
  progress events, operation ids, cancellation tokens, no stdout in the core.
- **I6** Input is a `[count][operator]{motion|object|command}` resolver from
  the first commit; v1 registers motions only.
- **I7** Selections persist in SQLite and are queryable via `in:'name'` and
  `marked`.
- **I8** TDD: tests first, no network in the default run, and a delegated task
  may not weaken its test list.

Schema decisions that predate the invariants and still hold:

- Landing tables store **BLOB, never TEXT** — encoding is detected later and
  must stay correctable without re-fetching.
- `package.date_precision` distinguishes ±1-week INDEX-derived dates from exact
  ones. `week` may be upgraded to `exact`, never the reverse.

## Resolved open questions

From `bam-handoff.md` §14, answered 2026-08-06:

- **Target platforms** — macOS and Linux primary. Windows is not a priority:
  `crossterm` keeps it compiling, nothing tests it, no CI runner.
- **LLM provider default** — local, **llama.cpp**. Its native GBNF support is
  why it leads; Ollama and cloud endpoints work through the same
  OpenAI-compatible implementation, differing only in `capabilities()`.
- **Target emulator** — the question dissolved: launchers are pluggable
  (I4). FS-UAE is implemented first because it runs on both primary platforms.
  Amiberry and vAmiga are unscheduled follow-ons.

Also decided this session: web variant is a **Rust server plus browser UI**
(with a WASM read-only build kept reachable by I1); pluggability is **traits
and registries now, with the extism WASM host as scheduled Phase 8**;
selections are **persisted and queryable**; the frontend is **Vue**.

## Still open

Nothing blocking. Mirror rsync access is decided low-priority (2026-08-06):
on-demand queueing with priority boosting is acceptable as the baseline even
if a full incremental harvest takes several hours; see the note at the top of
[phase-4-harvest-search.md](docs/plan/phase-4-harvest-search.md).
