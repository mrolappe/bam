# bam — Progress

Living status file, updated at the end of every implementation round.
Task ids refer to [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) and the
phase documents under [`docs/plan/`](docs/plan/). Each closed phase's
round-by-round log lives under [`docs/progress/`](docs/progress/), linked
from a short summary here in its place; the current, still-open phase stays
inline until it closes.

## Rounds 0–6 — 2026-08-06 · Phase 0/1: setup and planning → workspace scaffold → ingest pipeline

Full round-by-round log moved to
[docs/progress/phase-0-1-setup-ingest.md](docs/progress/phase-0-1-setup-ingest.md)
to keep this file scannable — it covers planning (Round 0), the Cargo
workspace/CI/purity scaffold plus fixtures (P0.1–P0.4, P1.1), the DB schema
and migration runner (P1.2–P1.3), the INDEX parser and charset decoder
(P1.4–P1.5), the normalizer (P1.6–P1.7), the RECENT upsert and `HttpClient`
(P1.8–P1.9), and the `bam ingest` CLI with typed `ProgressSink` events
(P1.10). 37 tests by the end of Round 6.

---

## Rounds 7–10 — 2026-08-06 · Phase 2: query IR → bam-dsl → SQL compiler → API layer → selections → `in:`/`marked` reconciliation

Full round-by-round log moved to
[docs/progress/phase-2-query-core.md](docs/progress/phase-2-query-core.md)
to keep this file scannable — it covers P2.1 through P2.8: the query IR and
field registry plus the `QueryLanguage` trait (P2.1–P2.2), the `bam-dsl`
grammar/parser/compiler (P2.3–P2.5), the `bam-core::api` use-case layer and
selections (P2.6–P2.7), and the `in:`/`marked` reconciliation pass (P2.8,
Phase 2 exit). 69 tests by the end of the phase (32 added across the four
rounds).

**Phase 2 exit reached.**

---
## Rounds 11–19 — 2026-08-06–2026-08-07 · Phase 3: input model → TUI shell → selections → highlighting → help overlay

Full round-by-round log moved to
[docs/progress/phase-3-tui.md](docs/progress/phase-3-tui.md) to keep this
file scannable — it covers P3.1 through P3.9: the vim-style input resolver
(P3.1–P3.2), default keymap with user overrides (P3.3), the virtualized TUI
shell (P3.4), the query input line with inline error markers (P3.5),
selection UI and the `:` command line (P3.6), semantic-token → ratatui
styling (P3.7), hot-reloadable highlight rules (P3.8), and the help overlay
(P3.9, Phase 3 exit). 110 tests by the end of the phase (37 added across the
nine rounds).

**Phase 3 exit reached.** A usable daily-driver TUI with configurable
vim-style bindings, persistent selections, hot-reloadable highlighting, and a
help overlay. Everything after this is additive, per the phase doc's own
closing line.

---

## Rounds 20–26 — 2026-08-07 · Phase 4: fetch queue → rate limiter → background worker → readme storage/parsing → FTS5 → readme prioritisation

Full round-by-round log moved to
[docs/progress/phase-4-harvest-search.md](docs/progress/phase-4-harvest-search.md)
to keep this file scannable — it covers P4.1 through P4.7: the `fetch_queue`
schema with atomic claim (P4.1), the token-bucket rate limiter (P4.2), the
background fetch worker with `robots.txt` and backoff (P4.3), readme landing
storage (P4.4), the readme header parser (P4.5), the FTS5 index over
description and readme text (P4.6), and prioritising readmes for
visible/filtered entries (P4.7, Phase 4 exit). 147 tests by the end of the
phase (31 added across the seven rounds).

**Phase 4 exit reached.** Full-text search over real readme content,
harvested politely and resumably, with visible/filtered entries prioritised.

---

## Rounds 27–34 — 2026-08-07 · Phase 5: blob cache → LRU eviction → unpacker registry → `unar`/`zip` backends → LHA header reader → `.uaem` sidecar → inventory enrichment

Full round-by-round log moved to
[docs/progress/phase-5-cache-extraction.md](docs/progress/phase-5-cache-extraction.md)
to keep this file scannable — it covers P5.1 through P5.8: the content-addressed
`BlobStore` trait and filesystem implementation (P5.1), LRU eviction with
pinning that never touches `enrichment` (P5.2), the `Unpacker` trait and
registry with magic-byte format detection (P5.3), the out-of-process `unar`
backend (P5.4), the in-process `zip` backend (P5.5), the LHA extended-header
reader with a flagged best-effort Amiga extension (P5.6), the `.uaem` sidecar
writer (P5.7), and archive inventory enrichment (P5.8, Phase 5 exit). 185
tests by the end of the phase (34 added across the eight rounds).

**Phase 5 exit reached.** Archives are cached by content hash, extracted
through a registry with two working backends, with Amiga attributes
preserved as `.uaem` sidecars and file inventories captured as enrichment —
§15's "hard core" is complete.

---

## Rounds 35–39 — 2026-08-08 · Phase 7: LLM provider → grammars → query prompt → embeddings/sqlite-vec → summaries

Full round-by-round log moved to
[docs/progress/phase-7-llm.md](docs/progress/phase-7-llm.md) to keep this
file scannable — it covers P7.1 through P7.5: the `LlmProvider` trait and
`OpenAiCompatibleProvider` covering llama.cpp/Ollama/cloud (P7.1), GBNF and
JSON Schema grammar generation from one source per query language (P7.2),
the natural-language-to-`bam-dsl` query generation prompt with the
always-editable, never-auto-run guarantee held structurally (P7.3), batched
resumable readme embeddings via sqlite-vec that make `Predicate::Similar`
real (P7.4), and batched resumable `llm_summary` enrichment with per-package
error isolation and a confirmation-gated cost estimate (P7.5, Phase 7
exit). 208 tests by the end of the phase (14 added across the five rounds).

**Phase 7 exit reached.** Natural-language search that emits inspectable
DSL, semantic similarity, and summaries — all runnable entirely locally
against a llama.cpp server, per §10's hard requirement.

## Next task

**P6.1 — `Launcher` trait, registry, probing** ([phase-6-launchers.md](docs/plan/phase-6-launchers.md)):
the third registry (alongside `QueryLanguage` and `Unpacker`, I4). `probe`/
`capabilities`/`launch`, where `capabilities()` (`directory_volume`,
`uaem_sidecars`, `hardfile`, `adf`) **drives selection, not just reporting**
— a request needing `directory_volume` must skip a launcher lacking it even
when otherwise preferred, and an unmet capability must be named in the
error rather than a generic "no launcher found". Marked **O**: the
capabilities-drive-behaviour contract is what keeps Phase 5's extraction
path emulator-agnostic as more launchers are added later (P6.2 FS-UAE first,
Amiberry/vAmiga unscheduled follow-ons).

**Tests first** (phase-6-launchers.md's own list):
- Two stub launchers register; the registry picks by configured preference.
- A launcher whose `probe` reports unavailable is never selected.
- A request needing `directory_volume` skips a launcher lacking it, even
  when that launcher is otherwise preferred.
- With no launcher able to satisfy a request, the error names the
  capability that could not be met.
- Config override wins, and overriding to an unavailable launcher errors
  clearly rather than falling back silently.

**Done when:** all five pass. Phase 6 continues with P6.2 (FS-UAE launcher,
S), P6.3 (`bam.toml` launcher config, H), P6.4 (launch a selection, S) —
see the phase doc for each.

Phases 8 and 9 remain open and unscheduled behind Phase 6 (additive,
resequenceable per `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s phase table) — Phase 8 is the
extism WASM plugin host (5 tasks), Phase 9 is the Vue/`bam-server`/Tauri
frontends (7 tasks). Phase 6 was chosen first only because it was the next
one picked in this round; nothing blocks reordering if a future session
prefers 8 or 9 instead.

## Decisions carried forward

The eight architectural invariants are stated in full in
[`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). In brief:

- **I1** `bam-core` compiles to wasm32 with `--no-default-features`; host
  capabilities live behind traits; `rusqlite` is confined to
  `bam_core::store::*`.
- **I2** The query IR plus field registry is the contract; surface syntaxes are
  pluggable implementations over it.
- **I3** Highlight rules name their query language, defaulting from config.
- **I4** Query languages, unpackers, and launchers share one registry pattern.
  Unpackers dispatch on magic bytes, not extensions.
  `Launcher::capabilities()` drives behaviour, not just reporting.
- **I5** The API layer is session-scoped: no global state, typed serializable
  progress events, operation ids, cancellation tokens, no stdout in the core.
- **I6** Input is a `[count][operator]{motion|object|command}` resolver from
  the first commit; v1 registers motions only.
- **I7** Selections persist in SQLite and are queryable via `in:'name'` and
  `marked`.
- **I8** TDD: tests first, no network in the default run, and a delegated task
  may not weaken its test list.

Schema decisions that predate the invariants and still hold:

- Landing tables store **BLOB, never TEXT** — encoding is detected later and
  must stay correctable without re-fetching.
- `package.date_precision` distinguishes ±1-week INDEX-derived dates from exact
  ones. `week` may be upgraded to `exact`, never the reverse.

## Resolved open questions

From `bam-handoff.md` §14, answered 2026-08-06:

- **Target platforms** — macOS and Linux primary. Windows is not a priority:
  `crossterm` keeps it compiling, nothing tests it, no CI runner.
- **LLM provider default** — local, **llama.cpp**. Its native GBNF support is
  why it leads; Ollama and cloud endpoints work through the same
  OpenAI-compatible implementation, differing only in `capabilities()`.
- **Target emulator** — the question dissolved: launchers are pluggable
  (I4). FS-UAE is implemented first because it runs on both primary platforms.
  Amiberry and vAmiga are unscheduled follow-ons.

Also decided this session: web variant is a **Rust server plus browser UI**
(with a WASM read-only build kept reachable by I1); pluggability is **traits
and registries now, with the extism WASM host as scheduled Phase 8**;
selections are **persisted and queryable**; the frontend is **Vue**.

## Still open

Nothing blocking. Mirror rsync access is decided low-priority (2026-08-06):
on-demand queueing with priority boosting is acceptable as the baseline even
if a full incremental harvest takes several hours; see the note at the top of
[phase-4-harvest-search.md](docs/plan/phase-4-harvest-search.md).
